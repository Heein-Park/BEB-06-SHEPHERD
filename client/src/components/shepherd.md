Iron in Korea is initially produced and distributed at the POSCO steel mill, and is then transported in large quantities to local iron processing plants. After that, it is moved to a large factory, which is a secondary brokerage in connection with the iron factory, and then traded again to a small-scale product manufacturing factory that receives iron.
    
This distribution process is accompanied by a huge amount of paperwork, such as shipment approval and delivery receipts, and the cost of paperwork and documentation is said to reach 1/5 of the total transportation cost. In addition, the existing paperwork increases the risk of the entire distribution chain due to the high possibility of accidental record omission and forgery.
    
If this process can be recorded and monitored with a blockchain, it is expected to increase transparency and increase work efficiency by checking the rapid distribution process between companies. POSCO, steelworks, and each company can prepare by identifying the current distribution period and exhaustion of issued iron in advance through the block chain, and the government will find it easier to tally the profits for each transaction that has occurred. Even if trading companies maliciously falsify the blockchain ledger after an agreement, forgery and falsification can be prevented because the steel production at POSCO is initially recorded and can be tracked against the initial production.
